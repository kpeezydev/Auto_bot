# Crypto Trading Bot - Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

**Goal:** To develop an automated trading bot that analyzes cryptocurrency price charts (initially AVAX/USDT on a chosen exchange) on an hourly timeframe and executes long, short, or exit trades based on a predefined technical analysis strategy.

**Primary Objectives:**
*   Automate trade execution based on technical signals.
*   Implement robust error handling and logging.
*   Develop a framework for strategy backtesting and paper trading.
*   Manage risk through position sizing and stop-losses.

**Disclaimer:** Cryptocurrency trading is highly speculative and involves substantial risk of loss. This project is undertaken with the understanding that profitability is not guaranteed, and significant capital can be lost. Start with paper trading and only deploy with capital you can afford to lose entirely.

## 2. Technology Stack

*   **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
*   **Exchange API Interaction:** `ccxt` library (provides a unified interface)
*   **Data Handling & Analysis:** `pandas`
*   **Technical Indicators:** `pandas-ta` or `TA-Lib`
*   **Scheduling:** `schedule` or `apscheduler` (for hourly execution)
*   **HTTP Requests (if needed directly):** `requests` or `aiohttp`
*   **Logging:** Python's built-in `logging` module
*   **Environment Management:** `venv` or `conda`
*   **Exchange:** [Specify Chosen Exchange, e.g., Binance, Kraken, Bybit]
*   **API Keys:** Securely managed (e.g., environment variables, configuration file *outside* version control). **NEVER COMMIT KEYS TO GIT.**
*   **(Optional) Database:** `sqlite3` (for simple logging/state) or PostgreSQL/MySQL (for more extensive data)
*   **(Optional) Backtesting Library:** `backtesting.py`, `vectorbt`, or custom implementation.

## 3. Core Features

*   **Data Fetching:** Retrieve 1-hour OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for the target trading pair(s) via the exchange API.
*   **Indicator Calculation:** Compute necessary technical indicators (e.g., SMAs, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) based on fetched data.
*   **Strategy Logic:** Implement clear, quantifiable rules for:
    *   Long entry signal generation.
    *   Short entry signal generation.
    *   Position exit signal generation (take profit, stop loss, signal reversal).
*   **Position Sizing:** Calculate trade size based on predefined risk parameters (e.g., risk % of capital per trade).
*   **Order Execution:** Place market or limit orders (buy/sell) via the exchange API based on strategy signals and position size. Handle potential API errors (rate limits, insufficient funds, etc.).
*   **Position Management:**
    *   Track current open position(s) (entry price, size, direction).
    *   Fetch current account balance/equity.
*   **Risk Management:**
    *   Implement stop-loss logic (either via exchange orders or bot logic).
    *   Implement take-profit logic (optional but recommended).
*   **Scheduling:** Execute the fetch-analyze-trade cycle reliably every hour.
*   **Logging:** Comprehensive logging of actions, decisions, signals, indicator values, orders placed, errors, and API responses.

## 4. Phases & Milestones

**Phase 0: Setup & Foundation (Est. Time: 1-2 days)**
*   [ ] Set up Python development environment (`venv`).
*   [ ] Install core libraries (`ccxt`, `pandas`, `pandas-ta`).
*   [ ] Obtain API keys from the chosen exchange (set up for Sandbox/Testnet if possible).
*   [ ] Securely configure API key access (e.g., environment variables).
*   [ ] Basic `ccxt` connection test: Fetch account balance, fetch ticker price.

**Phase 1: Data Pipeline (Est. Time: 2-4 days)**
*   [ ] Implement function to fetch 1h OHLCV data using `ccxt`.
*   [ ] Convert fetched data into a `pandas` DataFrame.
*   [ ] Handle potential errors during data fetching (API errors, network issues).
*   [ ] Store or cache fetched data appropriately if needed for backtesting.

**Phase 2: Strategy & Indicator Implementation (Est. Time: 3-7 days)**
*   [ ] Choose an initial *simple* strategy (e.g., Moving Average Crossover, RSI bounds).
*   [ ] Implement calculation of required indicators using `pandas-ta` on the DataFrame.
*   [ ] Code the precise entry and exit rules based on indicator values.
*   [ ] Output clear signals (e.g., `BUY`, `SELL`, `HOLD`, `CLOSE_LONG`, `CLOSE_SHORT`).

**Phase 3: Backtesting Framework (Est. Time: 5-10 days - *Crucial*)**
*   [ ] Develop or integrate a backtesting engine.
*   [ ] Feed historical data (from Phase 1) into the strategy logic (from Phase 2).
*   [ ] Simulate trades based on signals, accounting for *estimated* fees and slippage.
*   [ ] Calculate key performance metrics (Total Return, Max Drawdown, Win Rate, Profit Factor, Sharpe Ratio).
*   [ ] Iterate on the strategy based on backtesting results (beware of overfitting).

**Phase 4: Execution Engine (Paper Trading First!) (Est. Time: 4-8 days)**
*   [ ] Implement functions to place orders (`market`, `limit`) using `ccxt`.
*   [ ] Implement position sizing logic.
*   [ ] Integrate strategy signals with order execution functions.
*   [ ] Implement robust error handling for order placement/failures.
*   [ ] **Connect to Exchange Paper Trading / Testnet environment.**

**Phase 5: Position & Risk Management (Est. Time: 3-5 days)**
*   [ ] Implement logic to fetch and track the current open position(s).
*   [ ] Integrate stop-loss and take-profit logic into the execution engine or monitoring loop.
*   [ ] Ensure the bot only takes trades based on its current state (e.g., doesn't open long if already long).

**Phase 6: Scheduling & Logging (Est. Time: 2-4 days)**
*   [ ] Implement the main loop using `schedule` or `apscheduler` to run every hour.
*   [ ] Integrate comprehensive logging using the `logging` module. Log to both console and file.
*   [ ] Ensure the loop handles errors gracefully and continues execution.

**Phase 7: Extended Paper Trading (Est. Time: 2-4 weeks+ Ongoing)**
*   [ ] Run the *complete* bot on the paper trading account 24/7.
*   [ ] Monitor logs closely for errors and unexpected behavior.
*   [ ] Compare paper trading results with backtesting expectations.
*   [ ] Refine strategy, risk management, and error handling based on observations.

**Phase 8: Limited Live Deployment (Use Extreme Caution!) (Est. Time: Ongoing)**
*   [ ] If paper trading is satisfactory *and* risks are fully understood:
    *   [ ] Configure API keys for the live exchange.
    *   [ ] Deploy with a **very small** amount of capital you are comfortable losing.
    *   [ ] Monitor performance and logs *extremely* closely.
    *   [ ] Be prepared to shut down the bot immediately if issues arise.

**Phase 9: Monitoring & Maintenance (Est. Time: Ongoing)**
*   [ ] Regularly review logs and performance.
*   [ ] Update dependencies.
*   [ ] Adapt to potential exchange API changes.
*   [ ] Continuously evaluate and potentially refine the trading strategy (market conditions change).

## 5. Strategy Development Approach

*   **Start Simple:** Begin with well-understood indicators and simple rules (e.g., MA Crossover + RSI filter). Complexity increases the chance of bugs and overfitting.
*   **Quantify Rules:** All entry/exit conditions must be precise and programmable. Avoid vague descriptions.
*   **Backtest Rigorously:** Test over various market conditions (bull, bear, sideways). Be critical of results. Understand the metrics.
*   **Iterate:** Improve the strategy based on *both* backtesting and paper trading results.

## 6. Risk Management Strategy

*   **Capital Allocation:** Only trade with funds designated as high-risk capital.
*   **Position Sizing:** Implement a strict rule (e.g., risk no more than 1-2% of trading capital per trade). Calculate position size based on stop-loss distance.
*   **Stop-Loss:** *Mandatory*. Define clear stop-loss levels for every trade. Implement via exchange order if possible, otherwise via bot logic.
*   **Technical Risk Mitigation:** Robust error handling, thorough testing (unit, integration, paper trading), secure API key management, reliable deployment environment.
*   **Market Risk Mitigation:** Diversification (potentially multiple pairs/strategies *later*), strategy validation, awareness of market events.

## 7. Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Tests:** For critical, isolated functions (e.g., indicator calculations, position sizing).
*   **Integration Tests:** Test interactions between components (e.g., signal generation triggering order placement in test mode).
*   **Backtesting:** Simulate strategy performance on historical data. Validate logic and estimate potential profitability/drawdown.
*   **Paper Trading:** Simulate live trading without real capital on exchange testnets or via simulation. Test the full system end-to-end in near-real market conditions. **This is the most critical testing phase before risking capital.**

## 8. Deployment

*   **Initial Development/Testing:** Local machine.
*   **Paper/Live Trading:** Cloud Server / VPS (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, Linode, Google Cloud) for 24/7 uptime.
*   **Process Management:** Use tools like `systemd`, `supervisorctl`, or Docker to ensure the bot process runs reliably and restarts if it crashes.

## 9. Monitoring & Maintenance

*   **Regular Log Review:** Daily checks for errors or anomalies.
*   **Performance Tracking:** Monitor PnL, drawdown, trade frequency.
*   **System Health:** Check server resources, process status.
*   **Dependency Updates:** Periodically update libraries (`pip freeze > requirements.txt`, `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`).
*   **API Changes:** Stay informed about potential changes to the exchange API.

## 10. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

*   Support for multiple trading pairs.
*   More sophisticated strategies (machine learning - use with extreme caution!).
*   Portfolio-level risk management.
*   Web UI / Dashboard for monitoring.
*   Telegram/Email notifications for trades and critical errors.
*   Improved backtesting visualization.
*   Optimize API call frequency/efficiency.
